# aeroelasticipy

This project is a *re-edition* of my Master Thesis, done back in 2013/2014. My MT covered the analysis of the aeroelastic response of an UAV in a gust scenario.

This project was coded back then in Matlab, and was my first step into *serious* engineering programming. I had a lot of fun during the project, and now I revisit the memory chest to migrate the code to Python (3.x).

The objective is mainly to gain further numpy skills (I thought this is a good exercise; as a Data Scientist, I do work a lot with Pandas, but not so much directly with numpy arrays - *but Pedro, pandas dataframes are in essence 2D numpy arrays bla bla* - but **you know what I mean**, I'm talking about *fancy numpy*, *rocket science numpy*).

Furthermore, I was also curious about how could I improve the code performance (using less naive constructions, parallelizing the influence matrix construction, and have and excuse to also look through MinPy, to send my heavy numpy operations to GPU rather than CPU).

I will be working on this occasionally as a **hobby**, so I guess my contributions will be sparse in time.

If you somehow landed here, welcome.
(I also accept feedback, positive or negative)
